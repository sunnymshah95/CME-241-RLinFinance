# Assignment 4          

Things to do:
- type up question 1
- work on question 3 (modelling + coding + solving)
- code up question 4

Things done:
- I've set up the `value_iteration` and `policy_iteration` algorithms in the `frog_escape_setup.py` file
- I analyse the computational complexity in the `frog_escape_analysis.py` file

Potential Ideas:
- run the analysis experiments on the computational complexity in parallel to reduce time taken to run the algorithm
